America to this day sees Artificial Intelligence playing a huge role in higher education. AI generative tools can clearly show the inequality between classes; as AI can easily be catered towards students, it would integrate itself into classrooms to be able to help students with their projects. AI, however, isn't always able to provide for underpriveleged classes.
